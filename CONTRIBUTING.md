# Contributing Guide

Hello! Glad you stopped by. Here's how you can help out and some general rules
to follow.

## How to contribute

### Reporting issues

You are welcome to reach out with any questions, bugs, or feature requests by
creating a GitHub issue. When reporting bugs, try to come up with a short code
example that can reproduce the issue. Ideally, this should be less than ten
lines long.

### Submitting pull requests

If you want to make small changes, you can fork and send a pull request. For
more significant changes, start a discussion with a new issue first. The
[documentation](https://jsr.io/@roka) can be a great resource to help you
navigate the code. Every new feature or bug fix should include tests to verify
the intended functionality.

Pull request titles must follow the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) style. Common types
include:

- **feat**: New features
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **docs**: Documentation changes

### Contributing with AI

AI contributions are welcome, provided they are disclosed. Either the commits
have the corresponding bot author, or the pull request description mentions
which parts were generated by AI.

## Development

### Setup

1. Install [**deno**](https://deno.com)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `deno task ok .` to verify that all checks pass.

### Project structure

All Roka products, libraries, and tools are created in this single repository.

- Core packages: `core/`
- Development tools: `tool/`
  - **flow** tool: `tool/flow/` (linting and testing)
  - **forge** tool: `tool/forge/` (package management)

### Coding style

When working on the code, try to match the surrounding code style. If you're
unsure, consult the [Style Guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md) for detailed guidance and
examples.

### Linting and testing

This can be done with `deno lint` and `deno test`. The project also includes an
experimental tool called **flow** with similar functionality.

- Run all checks for unmerged changes: `deno task flow`
- Run all checks for a module: `deno task flow [path/to/module]`
- Run all tests from a file: `deno task flow test [path/to/file]`.

### Releases

Releases are automated using the **forge** tool and manually approved. This is
handled by the maintainers.

## Terms

By contributing to this repository, you agree to follow the
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and to let everyone use your
contributions under the same terms as the project.
