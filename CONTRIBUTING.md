# Contributing Guide

Hello! Glad you stopped by. Here's how you can help out and some general rules
to follow.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting issues

You are welcome to reach out with any questions, bugs, or feature requests by
creating a GitHub issue. When reporting bugs, try to come up with a short code
example that can reproduce the issue. Ideally, this should be less than ten
lines long.

### Submitting pull requests

If you want to make small changes, you can fork and send a pull request. For
more significant changes, start a discussion with a new issue first. The
[documentation](https://jsr.io/@roka) can be a great resource to help you
navigate the code.

Pull request titles must follow the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) style. Common types
include:

- **feat**: New features
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **docs**: Documentation changes

AI contributions are welcome, provided they are disclosed in the pull request.
Either the commits have the corresponding bot author, or the pull request
description mentions which parts were generated by AI.

## Development Setup

1. Install [Deno](https://deno.com)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `deno task flow .` to verify that all checks pass.

You can run checks on specific modules with `deno task flow [path/to/module]` or
run specific tests with `deno task flow test [path/to/test/file]`.

## Code Style

When working on the code, try to match the surrounding code style. If you're
unsure, consult the [Style Guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md) for detailed guidance and
examples.
